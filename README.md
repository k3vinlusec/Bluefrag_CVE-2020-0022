Dive into the analysis and exploitation of BlueFrag CVE-2020-0022 for Android 8.0 and 9.0. 

At the end of April 2020, insinuator posted their new research blog about a Bluetooth RCE vulnerability CVE-2020-0022 on Android 8.0 and 9.0. The author gave a detailed analysis and some details about how to exploit, as well as test python scripts. Regarding the exploit, the author didnâ€™t reveal the ROP chain in his post, just left the reader to finish it alone. In this post, I provide a dive into the analysis of this bug, and detail the exploitation by step-by-step debugging. In the end, I implemented the full ROP chain with 5 ROP gadgets by myself to complete the full exploit. The demo video is attached.
